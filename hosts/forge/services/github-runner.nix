# hosts/forge/services/github-runner.nix
#
# Host-specific configuration for the GitHub Actions self-hosted runner on 'forge'.
# This enables CI builds to run locally with direct access to Attic cache (when available).
#
# Prerequisites:
# 1. Create a fine-grained PAT at https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta
#    - Resource owner: carpenike
#    - Repository access: nix-config (or All repositories)
#    - Permissions: "Self-hosted runners" → Read and write
# 2. Add the token to SOPS secrets:
#    sops secrets/forge.sops.yaml
#    Add: github/runner-token: <your-token>
#
# After deployment, verify at:
#   https://github.com/carpenike/nix-config/settings/actions/runners

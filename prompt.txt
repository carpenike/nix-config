Thank you for waiting. Here are my search results on deploy-rs rollback with NixOS impermanence:

## Deploy-rs + Impermanence Compatibility Analysis

**Key Findings:**

1. **Auto-rollback Issues**: deploy-rs documentation actually recommends DISABLING autoRollback because "NixOS deployment can be a bit flaky (especially on unstable) and you may need to deploy twice to succeed, but auto rollback works against that and make your deployments constantly fail."

2. **No Explicit Compatibility Issues Found**: The search didn't reveal specific documented conflicts between deploy-rs rollback and impermanence.

3. **Potential Risk Areas**:
   - deploy-rs expects certain files/state to persist (canary files, activation scripts)
   - With impermanence, only explicitly persisted paths survive reboots
   - If deploy-rs state files aren't in persistence config, rollback could break

4. **Impermanence Best Practices**: Typical persistence includes `/var/lib/nixos`, `/etc/nixos`, SSH host keys - which should cover deploy-rs needs.

Now let me provide my comprehensive critical evaluation of both our analyses:

## Final Critical Technical Evaluation

### 1. Technical Merit - Deep Assessment

**VM Testing Implementation (★★★★★)**
- SOPS test key solution is elegant and practical
- Addresses the #1 operational risk without complexity
- Your concrete examples with test-specific secrets management are spot-on
- Integration with `nix flake check` provides excellent CI/CD foundation

**Enhanced Taskfile Approach (★★★★☆)**
- Parallel deployment with background jobs is clever
- Pre-deployment validation step is crucial
- Dynamic host discovery prevents sync issues
- Simpler than deploy-rs for this scale

**deploy-rs Future Consideration (★★★☆☆)**
- Benefits diminished by auto-rollback recommendations being to disable it
- Tool complexity vs. benefit ratio questionable for 4-host personal infrastructure
- No clear compatibility issues with impermanence, but adds deployment tool divergence

### 2. Constraint Analysis - Critical Points

**Performance & Scale:**
- Current remote build approach is actually optimal for mixed architectures
- 4 hosts don't justify complex deployment orchestration
- VM tests add valuable validation without performance penalty

**Security Model:**
- SSH-based deployment is appropriate for personal infrastructure
- VM tests with dummy secrets don't introduce new attack vectors
- Enhanced Taskfile maintains existing security posture

**Maintenance Burden:**
- VM tests require ongoing maintenance of test cases
- Enhanced Taskfile adds minimal complexity
- deploy-rs would require learning new tool and debugging unfamiliar issues

### 3. Risk Analysis - Previously Unconsidered

**VM Testing Risks:**
- Test maintenance debt if not disciplined about keeping tests minimal
- False confidence if tests don't accurately reflect production scenarios
- Need to ensure SOPS test keys don't accidentally encrypt real secrets

**Enhanced Taskfile Risks:**
- Background job failure handling could mask individual host failures
- jq dependency adds external requirement
- Parallel deployments could overwhelm network or target systems

**Architecture Evolution:**
- Current modular structure is excellent foundation
- Changes should preserve flexibility for future growth
- Avoid over-engineering for current scale

### 4. Final Synthesized Recommendation

After deep analysis of both perspectives, here's my refined recommendation:

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Next 2 weeks):**

1. **Implement Basic VM Testing**
   ```nix
   # Start with just 2-3 critical service tests
   checks.x86_64-linux = {
     nginx-basic = pkgs.testers.runNixOSTest {
       name = "nginx-starts";
       nodes.machine.imports = [ ../hosts/_modules/nixos/services/nginx ];
       testScript = ''machine.wait_for_unit("nginx.service")'';
     };
   };
   ```

2. **Add Pre-deployment Validation**
   ```yaml
   # Simple addition to existing apply-nixos task
   cmds:
     - nix flake check {{.ROOT_DIR}}  # Add this line
     - nix-shell -p nixos-rebuild --run '...'  # Existing command
   ```

**PHASE 2 (1-2 months):**

1. **Expand VM Test Coverage** - Add SOPS-aware tests for services that need secrets
2. **Parallel Deployment** - Implement enhanced Taskfile with background jobs
3. **Monitoring & Alerting** - Add basic deployment success/failure notifications

**EXPLICITLY DEFER:**
1. **deploy-rs Migration** - Current approach works well for this scale
2. **Dependency Injection Refactoring** - Low impact change
3. **Complex CI/CD** - Overkill for personal infrastructure

**Key Insight:** Your modular architecture is already excellent. The gap is validation, not orchestration. VM testing provides maximum safety improvement with minimal complexity increase.

This approach respects the pragmatic nature of personal infrastructure while adding crucial validation that scales naturally if the environment grows.

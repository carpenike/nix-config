# config files for sops & used for encrypting keys that sops-nix decrypts.
# each machine key is derieved from its generated `ssh_hosts_ed` file
# via ssh-to-age
# sops encrypts the secrets ready to decrypt with the private key of any of the below machines
# OR my 'main' key thats kept outside this repo securely.

# key-per-machine is a little more secure and a little more work than
# copying one key to each machine

# DEPRECATED: This file is no longer used in the backup system
#
# The backup system has been migrated to use Sanoid for ZFS snapshots
# and the main backup module at hosts/_modules/nixos/backup.nix handles
# all Restic backup orchestration with .zfs/snapshot path resolution.
#
# This file is kept for reference only and is not imported anywhere.
#
# Migration date: 2025-10-14
# See: hosts/_modules/nixos/backup.nix (lines 1691-1760) for current implementation
# See: hosts/_modules/nixos/storage/sanoid.nix for Sanoid configuration
